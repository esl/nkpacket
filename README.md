# NkPACKET: Generic Erlang transport layer

NkPACKET is a generic transport layer for Erlang. 

It can be used to develop high perfomance, low latency network servers, clients and proxies. 

### Features:
* Support for UDP, TCP/TLS, SCTP and WS/WSS.
* STUN server.
* Connection-oriented (even for UDP).
* DNS engine with full support for NAPTR and SRV location, including priority and weights.
* URL-mapping of servers and connections.
* Wrap over [Cowboy](https://github.com/ninenines/cowboy) to write domain-specific, high perfomance http servers.

In order to write a server or client using NkPACKET, you must define a _protocol_, an Erlang module implementing some of the callback functions defined in [nkpacket_protocol.erl](src/nkpacket_protocol.erl). All callbacks are optional. In your protocol callback module, you can specify available transports, default ports and callback functions for your protocol.

Listeners and connections can belong to a _group_, and can then be managed together. When sending packets, if a previous connection exists belonging to the same group, it will be used instead of starting a new one.


## Registering the protocol

If you want to use a _scheme_ associated with your protocol (like in  `my_scheme://0.0.0.0:5315;transport=wss`) you must _register_ your protocol with NkPACKET calling `nkpacket:register_protocol/2,3`. Different goups can have different protocol implementations for the same scheme:

```erlang
nkpacket:register_protocol(my_scheme, my_protocol)
```
In this example, the module `my_protocol.erl` must exist.


## Writing a server

After defining your callback protocol module, you can start your server calling [nkpacket:start_listener/2](src/nkpacket.erl). You must provide a `nkpacket:user_connection()` network specification, for example:

```erlang
nkpacket:start_listener("my_scheme://0.0.0.0:5315;transport=wss", 
						#{tcp_listeners=>100, idle_timeout=>5000})
```
or
```erlang
nkpacket:start_listener({my_protocol, wss, {0,0,0,0}, 5315}, 
						#{group=>my_group, tcp_listeners=>100, idle_timeout=>5000})
```
or even
```erlang
nkpacket:start_listener(my_domain, "my_scheme://0.0.0.0:5315;transport=wss;tcp_listeners=100;idle_timeout=5000")
```

There are many available options, like setting connection timeouts, start STUN servers fot UDP, TLS parameters, maximum number of connections, etc. (See `nkpacket:listener_opts()`). The following options are allowed in urls: idle_timeout, connect_timeout, sctp_out_streams, sctp_in_streams, no_dns_cache, tcp_listeners, host, path, ws_proto, tls_certfile, tls_keyfile, tls_cacertfile, tls_password, tls_verify, tls_depth.

NkPACKET will then start the indicated transport. When a new connection arrives, a new _connection process_ will be started, and the `conn_init/0` callback function in your protocol callback function will be called.
Incoming data will be _parsed_ and sent to your protocol module.

You can use the option `user` to pass specific metadata to the callback `init` function. If you use the url format, you can use header values, and they will generate an erlang `list()`. The following are equivalent:

```erlang
nkpacket:start_listener(my_domain, "my_scheme://0.0.0.0:5315;transport=wss", 
						#{user=>[{<<"key1">>, <<"value1">>}, <<"key2">>]})
```
and
```erlang
nkpacket:start_listener(my_domain, "my_scheme://0.0.0.0:5315;transport=wss?key1=value1&key2", 
						#{})
```

You can send packets over the started connection calling `nkpacket:send/2,3`. Packets will be _encoded_ calling the corresponding function in the callback module.

After a configurable timeout, if no packets are sent or received, the connection is dropped. 
Incoming UDP packets will also (by default) generate a new _connection_, associated to that remote _ip_ and _port_. New packets to/from the same ip and port will be sent/received through the same _connection process_. You can disable this behaviour.


## Writing a client

After defining the callback protocol module (if it is not already defined) you can send any packet to a remote server calling [nkpacket:send/2,3](src/nkpacket.erl), for example:

```erlang
nkpacket:send("my_scheme://my_host:5315;transport=wss", my_msg)
```
(to use urls like in this example you need to register your protocol previously).


After resolving `my_host` using the local DNS engine (using NAPTR and SRV if available), your message will be _encoded_ (using the corresponding callback function on your protocol callback module), and, if a connection is already started for the same _group_, _transport_, _ip_ and _port_, the packet will be sent through it. If none is available, or no group was specified, a new one will be automatically started. 

NkPACKET offers a sofisticated mechanism to specify destinations, with multiple fallback routes, forcing new or old connections, trying tcp after udp failure, etc. (See `nkpacket:send_opts()`). You can also force a new connection to start without sending any packet yet, calling `nkpacket:connect/2`.


## Writing a web server

NkPACKET includes two _pseudo_transports_: `http` and `https`.

NkPACKET registers on start the included protocol [nkpacket_protocol_http](src/nkpacket_protocol_http.erl), associating it with the schema `http` (only for _pseudo-transport http_) and the schema `https`  (for _pseudo-transport https_). You can then start a server listening on this protocol and transport.

NkPACKET allows several different domains to share the same web server. You must use the options `host` and/or `path` to filter and select the right domain to send the request to (see `nkpacket:listener_opts()`). You must also use `cowboy_dispatch` to process the request as an standard _Cowboy_ request.

For more specific behaviours, use `cowboy_opts` instead of `cowbow_dispatch`, including any supported Cowboy middlewares and environment.

You can of course register your own protocol using tranports `http` and `https` (using schemas `http` and `https` or not), implementing the callback function `http_init/3` (see [nkpacket_protocol_http](src/nkpacket_protocol_http.erl) for an example).


## Application configurarion

There are several aspects of NkPACKET that can be configured globally, using standard Erlang application environment:

Option|Type|Default|Comment
---|---|---|---
max_connections|`integer()`|1024|Maximum globally number of connections.
dns_cache_ttl|`integer()`|30000|Time to cache DNS queries. 0 to disable cache (msecs).
udp_timeout|`integer()`|30000|(msecs)
tcp_timeout|`integer()`|180000|(msecs)
sctp_timeout|`integer()`|180000|(msecs)
ws_timeout|`integer()`|180000|(msecs)
http_timeout|`integer()`|180000|(msecs)
connect_timeout|`integer()`|30000|(msecs)
sctp_out_streams|`integer()`|10|Default SCTP out streams
sctp_in_streams|`integer()`|10|Default SCTP in streams
tcp_listeners|`integer()`|10|Default number of TCP listeners
main_ip|`inet:ip4_address()`|auto|Main IPv4 of the host
main_ip6|`inet:ip6_address()`|auto|Main IPv6 of the host
ext_ip|`inet:ip4_address()`|auto|Public Ipv4 of the host
tls_certfile|`string()`|-|Custom certificate file
tls_keyfile|`string()`|-|Custom key file
tls_cacertfile|`string()`|-|Custom CA certificate file
tls_password|`string()`|-|Password fort the certificate
tls_verify|`boolean()`|false|If we must check certificate
tls_depth|`integer()`|0|TLS check depth

main_ip, main_ip6, if auto, are guessed from the main network cards.
ext_ip, if auto, is obtained using STUN.
None of them are used by nkpacket itself, but are available for client projects.


NkPACKET uses [logger](https://github.com/basho/logger) for log management.

NkPACKET needs Erlang >= 17 and it is tested on Linux and OSX.
